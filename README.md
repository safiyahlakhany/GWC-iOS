# Girls Who Code iOS Apps  👩🏽‍💻 📱
Apps I created in the Girls Who Code summer program 

## 1. Info App - Milk Before Cereal 🥣
Milk Before Cereal is the first iPhone app I created! It displays a compelling argument as to why milk should be poured before cereal. It gives the user a choice between "Milk First" and "Cereal First" afterwhich it displays the appropriate Gordon Ramsay GIF.

Activity Finder randomly recommends an activity upon the press of a button.
