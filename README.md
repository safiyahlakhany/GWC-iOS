## GWC-iOS
This Repository contains the 5 iOS apps I created while enrolled in the Girls Who Code iPhone App Development course

# 1. Info App - Milk Before Cereal
This is the first iPhone app I created! I displays a compelling argument as to why milk should be poured before cereal. Afterwards, it gives the user a choice between "Milk First" and "Cereal First". It displays a Gordon Ramsay gif accordingly.
